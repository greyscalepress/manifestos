# the cybertwee manifesto

the singularity is dear.

far too long have we succum to bitter edge of the idea that power is lost in the sweet and tender.

romantic is not weak. feminine is not weak. cute is not weak. we are fragmented and multifaceted bbs.

lack of emotion is oft favored because success is defined as the ability to be mechanical and efficient but sentimentality, empathy, and being too soft should not be seen as weaknesses.

we see the limitations of corporeality, as solipsists, we know that the body is the original prosthesis for operating in this universe. we know the body illusory, we curate our candy our sucre sickly sweet is intentional.
    
our nectar is not just a lure    
or a trap for passing flies   
but a self indulgent intrapersonal biofeedback mechanism spelled in emoji and gentle selfies.
