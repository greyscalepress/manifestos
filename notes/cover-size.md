### Safe Zone

Text and images must be at least .125" inside the trim lines.

### The spine of your book

Allow for 0.0625" variance on either side of the fold lines for your cover. For example, if your spine width is 1", your text should be no wider than 0.875". Because of this variance, avoid hard edges or lines that end on the fold line.

For books with 130 pages or less, we strongly recommend a blank spine. Blank spines are required for books with less than 101 pages. 

### Barcode

When your files go through the review process, our system will place your ISBN barcode in a 2" by 1.2" white box in the lower right-hand corner of your book's back cover.

If you choose to provide and place your own barcode, be sure it is a high-resolution image. The barcode can be located on the back or front cover of your book, at a recommended size of 2" wide by 1.2" tall.


## Size Calculation

53 * 0.0025 = 0.1325 inch    
120 * 0.0025 = 0.3 inch    
158 * 0.0025 = 0.395 inch

## Full cover surface (including bleed): 
height: 6.8750 (+ 0.25 bleed = 7.125")    
width: 4.25 + 0.3 + 4.25 = 8.8 (+ 0.25 bleed = 8.25")

158 pages:
width: 4.25 + 0.395 + 4.25 = 8.895 (+ 0.25 bleed = 9.145")
start of right page: 4.25+0.395 = 4.645

139 pages:
Spine width: 139 * 0.0025 = 0.3475
Cover width: 4.25 + 0.3475 + 4.25 = 8.8475 (+ 0.25 bleed = 9.0975")
Right page begins at: 4.25 + 0.3475 = 4.5975

144 pages:
Spine width: 144 * 0.0025 = 0.36 = move stuff by 0.125 to the right
Cover width: 4.25 + 0.36 + 4.25 = 8.86 (+ 0.25 bleed = 9.11")
Right page begins at: 4.25 + 0.36 = 4.61

187 pages:
Spine width: 187 * 0.0025 = 0.4675
Cover width: 4.25 + 0.4675 + 4.25 = 8.9675 (+ 0.25 bleed = 9.2175")
