## Software used

Here is what you need to install in order to compile the book:

### Pandoc

Source: [http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)

The package I am using: pandoc-1.14.0.1-osx.pkg

### TeX

Installer for Mac OSX: BasicTeX

[http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html](http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html)

The package I am using: basictex-20150613.pkg

### flushend.sty

This is a Latex extension that we use. It needs to be installed.

The method I used to install it: running this in the command line:

```sudo tlmgr install sttools```

### titlesec.sty

Another package we need to install...

Command:    
```sudo tlmgr install titlesec```

The titlesec package allows basic changes to the standard chapter style, including setting the font style and size or placement of the title.

### tocloft.sty

We want to control the Table of Contents: ```\usepackage{tocloft}```

Command:   
```sudo tlmgr install tocloft```


## Troubleshooting

Errors that can occur during compilation:

```! Undefined control sequence.
l.719 \tightlist```

```! Undefined control sequence.
l.4428 \afterpage```

```! LaTeX Error: \chaptermark undefined.```

This error is linked to the fancyhdr package, and is caused by using a document class without the \chapter command (article, scrartcl, ...).    
**Solution:** we need to use the "book" document class
